# How to use this file:
# Add a translation to the messages you wish to change, like this:
# - message: That player is not online.
#   translation: Ce joueur n'est pas en ligne.
# Colors can also be used, by means of prefixing color codes with an '&' symbol.
# The order of placeholders can be changed. Anything after the :, like the '02d' in {1:02d} is a Java String.format specifier. If you don't know what that is, I recommend leaving it as-is.
# INPORTANT: If your translation has a colon ( : ) character inside of it, you must enclose the entire part after "message: " in single quotes ( ' ).
# If this file doesn't work for some reason, check your console for errors with "SnakeYAML" included in them.
